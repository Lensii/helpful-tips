Here are some tips to help you figure out how to do certain things on the app!

- Deleting posts: Enter the comments view of the post. Tap the image to display an overlay. On the bottom right of the overlay there will be a three dots button; use it to delete the post.
- You can tap the "x/100 members" text before joining a chat room to see who's in it.
- Making a post to a certain category will share that post to all your chat rooms associated with that category. If you're the moderator of a room and you don't want people's posts to appear as messages, remove the appropriate category.
- If you cannot post or upload a profile picture, you may need to allow Pidgeon to access your photos via your phone settings.

Eventually, we will have a proper onboarding flow to explain these things.
